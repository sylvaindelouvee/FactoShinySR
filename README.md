The FactoShiny library is an extension to FactoMineR, a reference tool in R for multivariate data analysis. Developed by Husson, Mongé and Vaissié (2021), FactoShiny enables the creation of interactive web interfaces via the Shiny framework, thus facilitating access to complex analysis methods such as correspondence factor analysis and principal component analysis. The aim of FactoShiny is to facilitate the use of these methods by offering users an intuitive interface where in-depth analyses can be carried out without coding, thanks to interactive options and adjustable parameters.

FactoShinySR has been specifically designed to meet the needs of social representation analysis, a field in which correspondence factor analysis is often used to explore the representational structures of the social groups studied. This application adapts and extends FactoShiny's functionalities to include options for integrating multiple variables, managing evoked words, and performing correspondence analysis taking into account the specificities of social representation data. FactoShinySR incorporates interactive solutions for visualising significant contributions to the factorial axes and customising the graphical display, meeting the criteria of clarity and reproducibility that are essential in scientific publications.
